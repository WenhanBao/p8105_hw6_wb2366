## Problem1

Load the dataset and clean
```{r}
birthweight_df <- read_csv("birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = fct_infreq(as.factor(babysex)),
    frace = fct_infreq(as.factor(frace)),
    malform = fct_infreq(as.factor(malform)),
    mrace = fct_infreq(as.factor(mrace))
  )

apply(is.na(birthweight_df), 2, which) ## make sure that there is no missing value
```

Propose a regression model for birthweight. (birthweight may depend on mother's race)

```{r}

```
